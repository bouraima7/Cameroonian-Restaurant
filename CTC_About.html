<h2> About Us </h2>

<h3> Start Up </h3>

<p> Our owner has started this restaurant in 2020 and has brought Cameroon to the heart of Laurel. The exquisite taste allows cameroonians to take a visit to the homeland while they are here in the United States. </p> 

<h3> Origin </h3>

<p> We originate from Cameroon but we are not only limited to that country. We are an assimilation of several African Nations who have collaborated to make this restaurant presence occur. Our owner is cameroonian but we all stem from nations such as Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. We are the African Melting Pot!   </p>



<h3> Aspirations </h3>

<p> We have been ranked #1 in the DMV area for 6 months in a row. We would like to keep that up and even surpass it. There is no limit to what we can accomplish. Our goal is to eventually become the best African restaurant on the entire East Coast of the U.S.
